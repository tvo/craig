v2.0 -> v2.2
============
* Major technical change: the AI now runs as unsynced code.
  - CPU usage due to the AI happens only on one client, instead of all.
  - AI is actually susceptible to network lag now, unfortunately.
  - Desync bugs like the one in v2 can not exist anymore.
  - Architecture is more similar to GlobalAI. (AI DLLs)
  - There is a clear piece of framework code for building unsynced LUA AIs.
* Gadget properly removes itself now if there are no AI teams.
* Increased number of flag cappers from 12 to 24 for GBR, GER and US.
* Decreased number of flag cappers from 3 to 2 for Russia.
  (because it can not properly handle the combined builders/flagcappers yet)

v1.5 -> v2.0
============
* Added waypoint editor widget.
  - Can add new waypoints (press N).
  - Can remove waypoints (hold mouse button and press M).
  - Can move waypoints.
  - Can toggle connections between waypoints (drag).
  - Saves the profile in craig_maps/<mapname>.lua (create the 'craig_maps'
    directory if you want to try this widget and save your work.)
  - Automatically saves/loads the profile on shutdown/initialization.
* Added waypoint manager, to track flags and ownership of waypoints.
* Added pathfinder to navigate over the waypoint graph.
* Added flag capping (depends on map waypoint profile).
* Added some preliminary combat management (depends on map waypoint profile).
  - It will use multiple paths to your base.
  - It now sends units in "squads" of 24.
  - Units move at the speed of the slowest unit in the squad.
    (ie. tanks, halftracks and other vehicles stay between infantry.)
  - Units in a squad get their orders jittered around the waypoints,
    this way pinning/suppression is less effective to them and they magically
    take line formation when fighting other infantry.
* Added difficulty mod option.
  - Easy: no resource cheating.
  - Medium: cheats in 6% of what fits in storage every 128 game frames (~4 sec)
            (e.g. when it's stalling and has 1k storage, this means +14 extra)
  - Hard: infinite resources, as before.
  - Build order and unit limits can be configured per difficulty level.
* Included waypoint profiles for:
  - 1944_BocageSkirmish
  - 1944_BocageSmall
  - 1944_Caucasus_Skirmish_V4
  - 1944_Kiev_V4
  - 1944_Road_To_Rome_V3
  - 1944_Terra_Firma
  - Altair_Crossing-V1
  - Aquatic_Divide_TNM05-V2
  - Prokhorovka_1944
  - SnakeIslandV2
  - For maps not listed here, the AI falls back to v1.5 behaviour.

v1.1 -> v1.5
============
* Added configurable unit limit using gadget:AllowUnitCreation callin.
  - Construction vehicles are limited to one per AI team for each side.
  - Advanced engineers are limited to four per AI team for each side.
* Base building improvements:
  - Base builders of different types assist each other.
  - Buildings in base buildorder aren't skipped anymore when units get stuck.
  - Current build isn't interrupted anymore when units get stuck for a moment.
  - Current build isn't interrupted anymore when builder is reclaiming features.
  - Current build isn't interrupted anymore when a unit of same type dies.
  - Base builders take closest buildsite, instead of random one.
  - Base builders still take random buildsite if previous build was interrupted.
  - Speed up building placement algorithm by bumping segmentLength up.
* It doesn't stall on Command (metal) anymore.

v1 -> v1.1
==========
* Plays all sides now, credits to Journier for adding build orders.
