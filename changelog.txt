============
* Added configurable unit limit using gadget:AllowUnitCreation callin.
  - Construction vehicles are limited to one per AI team for each side.
  - Advanced engineers are limited to four per AI team for each side.
* Base building improvements:
  - Base builders of different types assist each other.
  - Buildings in base buildorder aren't skipped anymore when units get stuck.
  - Current build isn't interrupted anymore when units get stuck for a moment.
  - Current build isn't interrupted anymore when builder is reclaiming features.
  - Current build isn't interrupted anymore when a unit of same type dies.
  - Base builders take closest buildsite, instead of random one.
  - Base builders still take random buildsite if previous build was interrupted.

* It doesn't stall on Command (metal) anymore.
