v3.1 -> v3.2
============
* Fixed spring lockup (infinite loop) when all base buildings where limited
  and the base building algorithm reached end of the queue.
* New constructor syntax used in configuration.  (UnitArray, UnitSet, UnitBag)
* Moved unitlimits out of buildorder.lua into it's own file: unitlimits.lua
* Default difficulty level changed to medium.
* Waypoint editor changes:
  - Brush size in waypoint editor is now in world coordinates.
  - Loads from LuaRules/Configs/craig/maps as fallback.
  - Only need to hover over the waypoint when pressing M to delete it.
* S44: Huge nerf because of the complaints it was too hard
  - Now in all difficulties all factories are limited.
  - Barracks: 3 on easy, 3 on medium, 4 on hard.
  - Vehicle yard: 1 on easy and medium, 2 on hard.
  - Tank yard: 1 on easy, 2 on medium, 4 on hard.
  - Supply depot: 1 on easy and medium, 2 on hard.
* S44: Supply depot is now used to spam halftracks.
* S44: Fixed buildorder for Russia.  (now commissars can't clone themselves)
* Added waypoint profiles for:
  - 1944_Village_Crossing_v2
  - CenterrockV12

v3.0 -> v3.1
============
* Using exactly same code for SWIW and S44 now.
  - Squad size is now configurable.
  - Flag radius is now configurable.
  - Moved config in a directory with modShortName as name ('s44', 'swiw')
* Added waypoint profiles for:  (credits to Lowdive and hrmph!)

v2.0 -> v3.0
============
* Major technical change: the AI now runs as unsynced code.
  - CPU usage due to the AI happens only on one client, instead of all.
  - AI is actually susceptible to network lag now, unfortunately.
  - Desync bugs like the one in v2 can not exist anymore.
  - Architecture is more similar to GlobalAI. (AI DLLs)
  - There is a clear piece of framework code for building unsynced LUA AIs.
  - AI unit limits still work in synced code.
  - Properly seeded unsynced RNG, so math.random() can be used in configs.
  - Credits to lurker and BrainDamage for ideas/suggestions/testing.
* Gadget properly removes itself now if there are no AI teams.
* AI difficulty modoption uses numeric keys now, fixes it in TASClient.
* Reduced cheating at medium from 6% to 5%.
* Made bot name (as shown in the lobby) mod-agnostic, to ease maintenance.
* Doesn't try to cap allied flags anymore.
* Spring: 1944 specific changes:
  - Increased number of flag cappers from 12 to 24 for GBR, GER and US.
  - Decreased number of flag cappers from 3 to 2 for Russia.
    (because it can not properly handle the combined builders/flagcappers yet)
  - Based ModOptions.lua on the one from Operation Konstantin, instead of SVN.
* Star Wars Imperial Winter (SWIW) support, big thanks to [RoX]1v0ry_k1ng!
  - Three different buildorders for both Rebel Alliance and Imperial Remmnants.
  - Support for SWIW style flag capping (ie. flags swapped out using LUA).
  - The specific unit types used to to cap flags are now configurable.
  - Does not use NoSelect units (e.g. Royal Guards) anymore to attack.
  - Fixed Rebel Alliance commander base building bootstrap.
    (It tried to build on top of itself and then didn't move away.)
* Added waypoint profiles for:  (credits to [RoX]1v0ry_k1ng too)
  - ArcticPlainsV2
  - Eye_Of_Horus
  - TitanDuel
  - Tundra
  - Xelric_Draw_beta2

v1.5 -> v2.0
============
* Added waypoint editor widget.
  - Can add new waypoints (press N).
  - Can remove waypoints (hold mouse button and press M).
  - Can move waypoints.
  - Can toggle connections between waypoints (drag).
  - Saves the profile in craig_maps/<mapname>.lua (create the 'craig_maps'
    directory if you want to try this widget and save your work.)
  - Automatically saves/loads the profile on shutdown/initialization.
* Added waypoint manager, to track flags and ownership of waypoints.
* Added pathfinder to navigate over the waypoint graph.
* Added flag capping (depends on map waypoint profile).
* Added some preliminary combat management (depends on map waypoint profile).
  - It will use multiple paths to your base.
  - It now sends units in "squads" of 24.
  - Units move at the speed of the slowest unit in the squad.
    (ie. tanks, halftracks and other vehicles stay between infantry.)
  - Units in a squad get their orders jittered around the waypoints,
    this way pinning/suppression is less effective to them and they magically
    take line formation when fighting other infantry.
* Added difficulty mod option.
  - Easy: no resource cheating.
  - Medium: cheats in 6% of what fits in storage every 128 game frames (~4 sec)
            (e.g. when it's stalling and has 1k storage, this means +14 extra)
  - Hard: infinite resources, as before.
  - Build order and unit limits can be configured per difficulty level.
* Included waypoint profiles for:
  - 1944_BocageSkirmish
  - 1944_BocageSmall
  - 1944_Caucasus_Skirmish_V4
  - 1944_Kiev_V4
  - 1944_Road_To_Rome_V3
  - 1944_Terra_Firma
  - Altair_Crossing-V1
  - Aquatic_Divide_TNM05-V2
  - Prokhorovka_1944
  - SnakeIslandV2
  - For maps not listed here, the AI falls back to v1.5 behaviour.

v1.1 -> v1.5
============
* Added configurable unit limit using gadget:AllowUnitCreation callin.
  - Construction vehicles are limited to one per AI team for each side.
  - Advanced engineers are limited to four per AI team for each side.
* Base building improvements:
  - Base builders of different types assist each other.
  - Buildings in base buildorder aren't skipped anymore when units get stuck.
  - Current build isn't interrupted anymore when units get stuck for a moment.
  - Current build isn't interrupted anymore when builder is reclaiming features.
  - Current build isn't interrupted anymore when a unit of same type dies.
  - Base builders take closest buildsite, instead of random one.
  - Base builders still take random buildsite if previous build was interrupted.
  - Speed up building placement algorithm by bumping segmentLength up.
* It doesn't stall on Command (metal) anymore.

v1 -> v1.1
==========
* Plays all sides now, credits to Journier for adding build orders.
